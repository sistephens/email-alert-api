# Troubleshooting

## Fixing "PG::InsufficientPrivilege" error in the development VM

email-alert-api relies on PostgreSQL's `uuid-ossp` module. This is not
available by default and you might find running migrations results in
the following error:

```
PG::InsufficientPrivilege: ERROR:  permission denied to create extension "uuid-ossp"
```

This can be solved by:

```bash
> sudo -upostgres psql email-alert-api_development
psql> CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";
```

and then repeating for `email-alert-api_test`.

## Manually retrying failed notification jobs

In the event of an outage, the Email Alert API will enqueue failed
notification jobs in the Sidekiq retry queue. The retry queue size
can be viewed via Sidekiq monitoring or by running the following
command in a rails console:

```ruby
Sidekiq::RetrySet.new.size
```

To manually retry all jobs in the retry queue:

```ruby
Sidekiq::RetrySet.new.retry_all
```

See the [Sidekiq docs](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/API)
for more information.
